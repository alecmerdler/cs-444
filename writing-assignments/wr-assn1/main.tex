\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Processes}
    The explicit purpose of computers is to execute sets of instructions, called programs. As computers have increased
    in power and speed, the complexity and number of these programs has also increased. A simple program could count
    to the number ten, printing out each number along the way, then stop. The resources needed for a computer to
    execute this program would be minimal (barring any fancy recursion), and has only one explicit process: to
    count numbers. However, a more complex example would be a program that receives user input, performs extensive
    calculations, updates a database, and returns a result to the user. This type of program would be more aptly
    classified as a computer application, in that it contains many different components and processes, versus just
    counting numbers. Many of these processes can happen at the same time, and there can be duplicate processes in
    order to divide the work needed to be done. We can therefore think of a computer process as a program that is
    being executed, from which applications are built.

    \subsection{Threads}
    Each computer process requires resources in order to run, including the CPU, RAM, and hard disk storage. The
    operating system allocates these resources using threads.

    \subsection{CPU Scheduling}
    Any operating system that claims to be a multiprocessing operating system must have a way of managing all of
    the running processes and allocating system resources to them. One of the most critical resources is the CPU's
    time. Modern CPU's have multiple physical cores, which can execute their own process. However, in order to run
    even more processes at the same time, the operating system can quickly switch between different processes, giving
    them time to use the CPU, and creating the appearance of running many programs simultaneously.


\section{Linux}
    \subsection{Processes}
    Each process (also known as a task) in Linux is represented by a task\_struct data structure, which is naturally
    large and complex. Outlined below are the main basic functional areas and fields:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item State - Can be one of following: running, waiting, stopped, zombie
        \item Scheduling Information - Data regarding process precedence in the system
        \item Identifiers - Simply a unique number for the process
        \item Inter-Process Communication - Standard *nix information for processes to share data
        \item Links - Pointers to parent, sibling, and child processes
        \item Timers - Data about when the process was created and how much CPU time it has consumed
        \item File System - Pointers to working directories and other files
        \item Virtual Memory - How much virtual memory assigned to the process
        \item Processor Specific Context - Information that is needed to restart the process in the same state it was in
    \end{itemize}

    The tasks vector contains pointers to every task\_struct. The default size of the task vector is 512 entries, and
    the currently running process can be found using the current pointer.

\section{FreeBSD}
    \subsection{Processes}
    Processes in FreeBSD are similar to those in Linux in many ways. Each process has a unique process ID (PID). Each
    process has one owner and group whose permissions determine which files and devices the process can open. Processes
    also have a tree structure, with parent, sibling, and child processes.


\section{Windows}
    \subsection{Processes}
    Processes in Windows are similar to those in Linux in many ways. Each process contains a virtual address space,
    executable code, open handles to system objects, a security context, a unique process ID, environment variables,
    a priority class, minimum and maximum working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. Processes also
    have a tree structure, with parent, sibling, and child processes.

    Below is a code snippet showing how to create a child process in Windows using C++:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
        #include <windows.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <tchar.h>

        void _tmain( int argc, TCHAR *argv[] )
        {
            STARTUPINFO si;
            PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;

            ZeroMemory( &si, sizeof(si) );
            si.cb = sizeof(si);
            ZeroMemory( &pi, sizeof(pi) );

            if( argc != 2 )
            {
                printf("Usage: %s [cmdline]\n", argv[0]);
                return;
            }

            // Start the child process.
            if( !CreateProcess( NULL,   // No module name (use command line)
                argv[1],        // Command line
                NULL,           // Process handle not inheritable
                NULL,           // Thread handle not inheritable
                FALSE,          // Set handle inheritance to FALSE
                0,              // No creation flags
                NULL,           // Use parent's environment block
                NULL,           // Use parent's starting directory
                &si,            // Pointer to STARTUPINFO structure
                &pi )           // Pointer to PROCESS_INFORMATION structure
            )
            {
                printf( "CreateProcess failed (%d).\n", GetLastError() );
                return;
            }

            // Wait until child process exits.
            WaitForSingleObject( pi.hProcess, INFINITE );

            // Close process and thread handles.
            CloseHandle( pi.hProcess );
            CloseHandle( pi.hThread );
        }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{Threads}
    Each Windows process is started with a single thread, but can create more threads which all share its virtual
    address space and system resources. Threads can be created by using the CreateThread function, which returns a
    handle to the thread.

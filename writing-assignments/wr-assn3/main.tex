\section{Introduction}
An essential function of computers is memory management. This is the process of loading data from disk and assigning
it to a contiguous block of main memory, called a page. This reduces the number of disk reads the operating system 
needs to perform, which was a fundamentally slow operation (until the advent of solid state drives). Memory can 
also be allocated to running programs to be used in their processes, and then needs to be cleaned up and 
reallocated.

\section{Windows}
The core memory management system in Windows is called the Memory Manager. The system has two primary tasks: mapping 
the virtual address space of a process to physical memory, and paging some contents of memory to disk. The Memory 
Manager ensures that when a process reads from or writes to memory, it is referencing the correct address. Paging 
memory contents to disk occurs when a running process attempts to use more virtual memory than the machine
has in physical memory.

\subsection{Design}
The Windows Memory Manager is comprised of several executive system services and components. These components 
include executive system services for allocating and deallocating memory, managing virtual 
memory, resolving hardware memory management exceptions, the balance set manager, the process/stack swapper, 
the modifier page writer, the mapper page writer, the segment deference thread, and the zero page thread.


\section{FreeBSD}
The memory management system in FreeBSD is hierarchical in nature. First, there is the main primary memory system.
This is usually random access memory (RAM). Secondary memory is usually hard disk or solid state drives. In 
this model, all processes run in the virtual address space. References to the virtual address space are 
interpreted by the hardware to references in physical memory by a process called address translation.

\section{Design}
FreeBSD implements a private address space for each of its processes. This address space is divided into three 
segments: text, data, and stack. The text segment is read only and contains the machine instructions of 
the program. It is where the programs code is stored and pulled during execution. The data segment 
contains initialized and uninitialized data of the program. The stack segment contains the runtime stack 
of the program.

\section{Comparison to Linux}
While the design and implementation of memory management in FreeBSD and Linux are very similar, there are 
some notable differences. One such difference is the use of

};
